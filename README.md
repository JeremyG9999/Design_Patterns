# Design Patterns

A collection of classic design pattern implementations in Python, useful for learning and applying common software design solutions.

## Features

- **Adapter Pattern**  
  Converts the interface of a class into another interface clients expect, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together.

- **Builder Pattern**  
  Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, enabling the same construction process to create different representations.

- **Factory Pattern**  
  Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

- **Observer Pattern**  
  Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

- **Singleton Pattern**  
  Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

- **State Pattern**  
  Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, appearing to change its class.

- **Strategy Pattern**  
  Enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime by encapsulating algorithms within classes.
